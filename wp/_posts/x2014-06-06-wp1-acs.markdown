We propose and solve a small-scale New-Keynesian model with Markov sunspot
shocks that move the economy between a targeted-inflation regime and a deflation
regime and fit it to data from the U.S. and Japan. For the U.S. we find that adverse
demand shocks have moved the economy to the zero lower bound (ZLB) in 2009 and
an expansive monetary policy has kept it there subsequently. In contrast, Japan has
experienced a switch to the deflation regime in 1999 and remained there since then,
except for a short period. The two scenarios have drastically different implications for
macroeconomic policies. Fiscal multipliers are about 20% smaller in the deflationary
regime, despite the economy remaining at the ZLB. While a commitment by the central
bank to keep rates near the ZLB doubles the fiscal multipliers in the targeted-inflation
regime (U.S.), it has no effect in the deflation regime (Japan).
