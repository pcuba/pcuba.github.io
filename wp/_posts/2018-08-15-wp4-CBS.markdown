#### With [Sanjay R. Singh (UC Davis)](https://sites.google.com/a/brown.edu/sanjaysingh/)

We theoretically explore issues of long-run stagnation in a representative agent framework and compare expectations-driven stagnation to a secular stagnation episode. This contrast provides novel policy implications. Our findings extend to a quantitative DSGE model in which we reassess Japan's experience from a prolonged liquidity trap.
